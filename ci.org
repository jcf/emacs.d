* Continuous Integration

In order to verify the behaviour of this Emacs configuration a number of
Cucumber features are provided, and executed by [[https://github.com/ecukes/ecukes][ecukes]].

Tests can be run locally via ~cask exec ecukes --no-win~, and will be run every
time a changeset is pushed up to GitHub thanks to [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]].

* CircleCI

Our CircleCI build is configured using a YAML file at the root of the
repository.

** Machine (environment)

Configuration of the build is done via environment variables, that can be set in
one of a number of ways with CircleCI. For globally available environment
variables we can use the `machine.environment` path.

#+begin_src yaml
machine:
  environment:
    CASK_URL: https://raw.github.com/cask/cask/master/go
    EMACS_VERSION: 24.5
    EVM_TARGET: emacs-24.5-bin
    EVM_URL: https://raw.github.com/rejeep/evm/master/go
    PATH: "/home/ubuntu/.cask/bin:/home/ubuntu/.evm/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

** Checkout

CircleCI clones the repository into ~/home/ubuntu/emacs.d~, but Emacs and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]]
expect our configuration to live in ~/home/ubuntu/.emacs.d~. The simplest fix
for this is to symlink our cloned repository.

Attempting to change where the repository is cloned results in a lot of fiddling
because every command starts in the 'hardcoded' default directory of
~/home/ubuntu/emacs.d~.

#+begin_src yaml
checkout:
  post:
    - ln -s ~/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

** Dependencies

Firstly we specify which directories we want to cache between builds. Doing so
should significantly speed up running our tests by avoiding expensive tasks like
downloading and compiling dependencies.

#+begin_src yaml
dependencies:
  cache_directories:
    - /usr/local/evm
    - ~/.cask
    - ~/emacs.d/.cask
#+end_src

Now we to install a recent version of Emacs, which we do using evm. As soon as
Emacs is installed, we install Cask by cloning the repository into ~~/.cask~
(using the installer fails because it insists on picking up Emacs 23, which is
not supported).

#+begin_src yaml
  pre:
    - echo $PATH
    - sudo mkdir /usr/local/evm && sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /usr/local/evm
    - curl -fsSkL $EVM_URL | bash
    - evm install $EVM_TARGET --use --skip
    - '[[ -d "~/.cask" ]] || git clone https://github.com/cask/cask.git ~/.cask'
#+end_src

Dependencies are installed with a wrapper script that tells Cask where to find
Emacs by setting `EMACS`.

#+begin_src yaml
  override:
    - bin/cask install
#+end_src

The script itself is pretty simple.

#+begin_src sh :tangle bin/cask :shebang #!/bin/bash
set -e
EMACS="$(evm bin $EVM_TARGET)" cask $@
#+end_src

** Test

#+begin_src yaml
test:
  override:
    - bin/cask exec ecukes --no-win
#+end_src
